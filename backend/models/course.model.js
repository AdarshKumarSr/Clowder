    subtitle: "Why Learn DSA?",
    content: `Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the backbone of efficient programming. Whether you're solving a real-world problem or preparing for coding interviews, mastering DSA helps you:

- Write optimized code
- Think logically and structurally
- Crack tech interviews`,

    title: "What is a Data Structure?",
    content: `A Data Structure is a way to store, organize, and manage data so it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

Think of it like organizing files in a cabinet â€” you can find them faster if theyâ€™re arranged smartly.`,

        question: "Which of the following is NOT a data structure?",
        options: ["Stack", "Array", "Sorting", "Queue"],
        correctAnswer: "Sorting",
        explanation: "Sorting is an algorithm, not a data structure."

    title: "What is an Algorithm?",
    content: `An Algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions to solve a specific problem.

For example, a recipe for making a cake is an algorithm!`,
    mcqs: [
      {
        question: "Which of these best describes an algorithm in everyday life?",
        options: ["A photo album", "A cooking recipe", "A TV remote", "A bookshelf"],
        correctAnswer: "A cooking recipe",
        explanation: "It provides clear steps to produce a result â€” like an algorithm."

    title: "Time and Space Complexity",
    content: `Every algorithm has a cost:

- **Time complexity**: How long it takes to run  
- **Space complexity**: How much memory it uses

We use Big O notation to express the worst-case performance.  
Example: Searching an unsorted array is O(n) time.`,

        correctAnswer:"Linear Search â†’ O(n)",
        explanation: "Each algorithm has a standard time complexity â€” O(n log n) is not for Binary Search but for efficient sorts like Merge Sort."

        correctAnswer: "True",
        explanation: "They are both linear because they store data in sequence."
